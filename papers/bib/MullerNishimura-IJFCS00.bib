  We present a constraint system, OF, of feature trees that is
  appropriate to specify and implement type inference for first-class
  messages. OF extends traditional systems of feature constraints by a
  selection constraint $x\langle y\rangle z$, ``by first-class feature
  tree'' $y$, which is in contrast to the standard selection
  constraint $x[f]y$, ``by fixed feature''~$f$.  We
  investigate the satisfiability problem of OF and show that it can be
  solved in polynomial time, and even in quadratic time if the number
  of features is bounded. We compare OF with Treinen's system EF of
  feature constraints with first-class features, which has an
  NP-complete satisfiability problem. This comparison yields that the
  satisfiability problem for OF with negation is NP-hard.  We even
  obtain NP-completeness, for a specific subclass of OF with negation
  that is useful for a related type inference problem.  Based
  on OF we give a simple account of type inference for first-class
  messages in the spirit of Nishimura's recent proposal, and we show
  that it has polynomial time complexity: We also highlight an
  immediate extension of this type system that is desirable but makes
  type inference NP-complete.}
