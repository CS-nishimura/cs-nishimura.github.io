This paper proposes a modal extension of 
Separation Logic for reasoning about data-parallel programs that manipulate 
heap allocated linked data structures. 
Separation Logic provides a formal means for expressing 
allocation of disjoint substructures, which are to be processed
in parallel. A modal operator is also introduced to relate
the global property of a parallel operation with
the local property of each sequential execution running in parallel. 
The effectiveness of the logic is demonstrated through 
a formal reasoning on the parallel 
list scan algorithm featuring the pointer jumping technique.
