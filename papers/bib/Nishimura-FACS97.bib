  The paper proposes a strict functional language to program with
  cyclic recursive data structures. In the language, each recursive
  datum is represented by a system of equations. Cyclic structures 
  are naturally expressed by this representation, and the language
  provides a general mechanism that transforms several such systems of
  equations into a single new system of equations. An operational
  semantics and a polymorphic type system for the language are given,
  and a type soundness proof is sketched. Finally, it is also shown
  that the language can be implemented in a data-parallel fashion.}
