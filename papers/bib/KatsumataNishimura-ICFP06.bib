 abstract = {We present a unifying solution to the problem of fusion
 of functions, where both the producer function and the consumer
 function have one accumulating parameter. The key idea in this
 development is to formulate the producer function as a function which
 computes over a monoid of data contexts. Upon this formulation, we
 develop a fusion method called algebraic fusion based on the
 elementary theory of universal algebra and monoids. The producer
 function is fused with a monoid homomorphism that is derived from the
 definition of the consumer function, and is turned into a
 higher-order function f that computes over the monoid of
 endofunctions.We then introduce a general concept called improvement,
 in order to reduce the cost of computing over the monoid of
 endofunctions (i.e., function closures). An improvement of the
 function f via a monoid homomorphism h is a function g that satisfies
 f =h g. This provides a principled way of finding a first-order
 function representing a solution to the fusion problem. It also
 presents a clean and unifying account for varying fusion methods that
 have been proposed so far. Furthermore, we show that our method
 extends to support partial and infinite data structures, by means of
 an appropriate monoid structure.}
