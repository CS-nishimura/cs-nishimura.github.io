    In their recent paper (GandALF 2018), Goubault, Ledent, and
    Rajsbaum provided a formal epistemic model for distributed
    computing. Their logical model, as an alternative to the
    well-studied topological model, provides an attractive
    framework for refuting the solvability of a given
    distributed task by means of logical obstruction: One just
    needs to devise a formula, in the formal language of
    epistemic logic, that describes a discrepancy between the
    model of computation and that of the task. However, few
    instances of logical obstruction were presented  
    in their paper and specifically logical obstruction to the
    wait-free 2-set agreement task was left as an open problem.
    Soon later, Nishida affirmatively answered to the problem
    by providing inductively defined logical obstruction
    formulas to the wait-free $k$-set agreement tasks. 
    
    The present paper refines Nishida's work and devises
    logical obstruction formulas to $k$-set agreement tasks for
    superset-closed adversaries, which supersede the wait-free
    model. These instances of logical obstruction formulas
    exemplify that the logical framework can provide yet
    another feasible method for showing impossibility of
    distributed tasks, though it is currently being confined to
    one-round distributed protocols. The logical method has an
    advantage over the topological method that it enjoys a
    self-contained, elementary induction proof. This is in
    contrast to topological methods, in which sophisticated
    topological tools, such as Nerve lemma, are often assumed
    as granted.   }
