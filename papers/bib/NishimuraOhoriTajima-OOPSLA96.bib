  abstract =	{
	This paper presents an equational formulation of an object-oriented
	data model. In this model, a database is represented as a {\em
	system of equations\/} over a set of oid's,
	and a database query is a transformation of a system of
	equations into another system of equations.
	During the query processing, our model maintains an {\em equivalence
	relation\/} over oid's that relates oid's corresponding to the
	same ``real-world entity.'' By this mechanism, the model achieves a
	declarative set-based query language and views for objects with
	identity. Moreover, the query primitives are designed so that
	queries including object traversal can be evaluated in a data-parallel
	fashion.}
