	This article proposes a new language mechanism for
	data-parallel processing of dynamically allocated recursively defined
	data. Different from the conventional array-based data-parallelism,
	it allows parallel processing of general recursively defined
	data such as lists or trees in a functional way. 
	This is achieved by representing a recursively defined datum as
	a system of equations, and defining new language constructs for
	parallel transformation of a system of equations.
	By integrating them with a higher-order functional
	language, we obtain a functional programming language 
	suitable for describing data-parallel algorithms 
	on recursively defined data in a declarative way.
	The language has an ML style polymorphic type system and a
	type sound operational semantics that uniformly integrates the
	parallel evaluation mechanism with the semantics of a typed functional
	language. We also show the intended parallel execution model 
	behind the formal semantics, assuming an idealized 
	distributed memory multicomputer. }
