  abstract = {
  We present a fully abstract game semantics for an Algol-like
  parallel language with non-blocking synchronization primitive.  
  Elaborating on Harmer's game model for nondeterminism, we develop
  a game framework appropriate for modeling parallelism.  The game is
  a sophistication of the wait-notify game proposed in a previous
  work, which makes the signals for thread scheduling explicit with 
  a certain set of extra moves. The extra moves induce a Kleisli category 
  of games, on which   we develop a game semantics of the Algol-like 
  parallel language and establish the full abstraction result with 
  a significant use of the non-blocking synchronization operation.}
