  abstract = {
  We propose a new algorithm for fusion transformation 
  that allows both stacks and accumulating parameters. 
  The new algorithm can fuse programs that cannot be 
  handled by existing fusion techniques, e.g., XML transformations.
  The algorithm is formulated in a modular, type-directed style 
  where the transformation process is comprised of
  several transformation steps that change types
  but preserve the observational behavior of programs. 
  We identify a class of functions to which our new fusion
  method successfully applies and show that
  a closure property holds for that class. }
