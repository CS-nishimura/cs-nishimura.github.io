  This paper develops a new framework for fusion that is designed for
  eliminating the intermediate data structures involved in the
  composition of functions that have one accumulating parameter. The new
  fusion framework comprises two steps: algebraic fusion and its
  subsequent improvement process. The key idea in our development is to
  regard functions with an accumulating parameter as functions that
  operate over the monoid of data contexts.  Algebraic fusion composes
  each such function with a monoid homomorphism that is derived from the
  definition of the consumer function to obtain a higher-order function
  that computes over the monoid of endofunctions. The transformation
  result may be further refined by an improvement process, which
  replaces the operation over the monoid of endofunctions (i.e.,
  function closures) with another monoid operation over a monoid
  structure other than function closures.

  Using our framework, one can formulate a particular solution to the
  fusion problem by devising appropriate monoids and monoid
  homomorphisms. This provides a unified exposition of a variety of
  fusion methods that have been developed so far in different
  formalisms.  Furthermore, the cleaner formulation makes it possible to
  argue about some delicate issues on a firm mathematical basis. We
  demonstrate that algebraic fusion and improvement in the world of
  complete pointed partial orders (CPOs) and continuous functions can
  correctly fuse functions that operate on partial and infinite data
  structures. We also show that subtle differences in termination
  behaviours of transformed programmes caused by certain different
  fusion methods can be cleanly explained by corresponding improvement
  processes that have different underlying monoid structures.
