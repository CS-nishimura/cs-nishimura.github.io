  abstract = {The syntactic logical relations
developed by Pitts are applied to show the correctness
of a higher-order removal program transformation algorithm.
The convenient proof method that resorts to
the induction on the structure of programs
does not apply because of the
circular references to be introduced by the transformation. 
Using a variant of the syntactic logical relations,
in which every pair of the transformation source and target are related,
one can break the circularity and make an inductive proof go through. 
This demonstrates that the syntactic logical relations
provide a basis of another general proof method
for showing the correctness of program transformations.}
