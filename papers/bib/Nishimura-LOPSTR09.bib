  abstract = {
  This paper discusses refinement of programs that may raise and
  catch exceptions.  We show that exceptions are expressed by a
  class of predicate transformers built on Arieli and Avron's
  four-valued logic and develop a refinement framework for the
  four-valued predicate transformers.  The resulting framework
  enjoys several refinement laws that are useful for stepwise
  refinement of programs involving exception handling and partial
  predicates.  We demonstrate some typical usages of the
  refinement laws in the proposed framework by a few examples of
  program transformation.}
